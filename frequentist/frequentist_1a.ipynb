In this case, the population is infinite because we could keep drawing our normal random variates until our computers die. In general, the sample mean we calculate will not be equal to the population mean (as we saw above). A consequence of this is that the sum of squares of the deviations from the _population_ mean will be bigger than the sum of squares of the deviations from the _sample_ mean. In other words, the sum of squares of the deviations from the _sample_ mean is too small to give an unbiased estimate of the _population_ variance. An example of this effect is given [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction#Source_of_bias). Scaling our estimate of the variance by the factor $n/(n-1)$ gives an unbiased estimator of the population variance. This factor is known as [Bessel's correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction). The consequence of this is that the $n$ in the denominator is replaced by $n-1$.\n",

We've said a couple of times that we rarely, if ever, know the true population parameters; we have to estimate them from our sample and we cannot even begin to estimate the standard deviation from a single observation. This is very true and usually we have sample sizes larger than one. This means we can calculate the mean of the sample as our best estimate of the population mean and the standard deviation as our best estimate of the population standard deviation. In other words, we are now coming to deal with the sampling distributions we mentioned above as we are generally concerned with the properties of the sample means we obtain.\n",

We remind ourselves that another result from the CLT is that _even if the underlying population distribution is not normal, the sampling distribution will tend to become normal with sufficiently large sample size_. This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places. In reality this is simply a rule of thumb; if the underlying distribution is approximately normal then your sampling distribution will already be pretty normal, but if the underlying distribution is heavily skewed then you'd want to increase your sample size."
